Transpose of a Matrix and Basic Matrix Operations
The lecture explains the transpose of a matrix in a simple and understandable manner. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. What is the transpose of a matrix?
Transpose means converting rows into columns and columns into rows.

There is no calculation involved — it’s just rearranging.

Example:
A given matrix

makefile
Copy
Edit
E = | 2   1   3 |
    | 4  -7   8 |
    | 6   9 -10 |
Rows: R1, R2, R3

Columns: C1, C2, C3
Transpose (Eᵗ):

markdown
Copy
Edit
Eᵗ = | 2   4   6 |
     | 1  -7   9 |
     | 3   8 -10 |
2. How to transpose any matrix:
Take each column and write it as a row.

Example:

Column 1 → Row 1

Column 2 → Row 2

Column 3 → Row 3

3. Transpose Examples with Two Matrices
Given:

java
Copy
Edit
Matrix A = |  2  -3   4 |
           |  1   5   6 |
           |  7   8  -5 |

Matrix B = |  2  -8   9 |
           |  1   5   4 |
           |  2   3  -8 |
Transpose them:

markdown
Copy
Edit
Aᵗ = | 2   1   7 |
      |-3   5   8 |
      | 4   6  -5 |

Bᵗ = | 2   1   2 |
      |-8   5   3 |
      | 9   4  -8 |
4. Proof: (A + B)ᵗ = Aᵗ + Bᵗ
To verify this identity, use two small 2×2 matrices:

makefile
Copy
Edit
A = |  1   2 |
    | -1   4 |

B = |  5   8 |
    | -4   6 |
Step 1: Calculate (A + B)ᵗ
Add matrices:

markdown
Copy
Edit
A + B = |  6  10 |
        | -5  10 |
Transpose it:

markdown
Copy
Edit
(A + B)ᵗ = |  6  -5 |
           | 10  10 |
Step 2: Calculate Aᵗ + Bᵗ
Aᵗ =

Copy
Edit
|  1  -1 |
|  2   4 |
Bᵗ =

Copy
Edit
|  5  -4 |
|  8   6 |
Add them:

markdown
Copy
Edit
Aᵗ + Bᵗ = |  6  -5 |
           | 10  10 |
Conclusion:
Both sides are equal →
(A + B)ᵗ = Aᵗ + Bᵗ is proven with a simple example.
