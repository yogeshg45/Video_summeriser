âœ… Math Concepts Identified
1. Coordinates and Ordered Pairs
Mentions of points like (6,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,6) suggest the use of coordinate geometry.

Possibly discussing plotting points on the Cartesian plane and comparing them.

2. Speed-Time Graph
Discussion includes:

Speed and Time Relationship

Graphical Representation

The graph shows how speed varies with time.

Mention of terms like:

"Speed-O'd-A" = Speed of A

"Time-O'd-A" = Time of A

"increase" / "reverse" / "direct variation"

This suggests students are:

Learning about Direct Variation: If speed increases with time or not.

Possibly analyzing linear or nonlinear relationships.
