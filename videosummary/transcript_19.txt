You were discussing the topic of solving systems of linear equations using matrices, specifically about the rank of matrices and the consistency of the system. The key points are:

If the rank of the coefficient matrix (A) is not equal to the rank of the augmented matrix (A|B), then the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution.

If the rank of A equals the rank of the augmented matrix (A|B) and this rank is equal to the number of unknown variables, then the system is consistent and has a unique solution.

If the rank of A equals the rank of the augmented matrix (A|B) but this rank is less than the number of unknown variables, the system is consistent and has infinitely many solutions. The general solution will have free parameters equal to the difference between the number of variables and the rank of the matrix.
