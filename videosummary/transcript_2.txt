Matrix and Determinant Discussion:

There’s a mention of a matrix and calculating its minor and determinant.

Example: "minor of determinant 451 - 3", "determinant of 152 - 3", and similar lines.

There’s a discussion about a matrix being singular or not (a matrix is singular if its determinant is zero).

You are likely discussing properties of a square matrix like:

If 
det
⁡
(
𝐴
)
=
0
⇒
𝐴
 is singular (non-invertible)
.
If det(A)=0⇒A is singular (non-invertible).
Repeated Matrix Elements:

Mentions of elements like A, B in combinations: "A, B, B, A, B, A..." etc.

Possibly a matrix pattern or repetition being described.

Confusion or Frustration:

Sentences like:

"Is this a question?", "Say it!", "Why?", "Tell properly", "Is this correct?",
suggesting a tone of frustration or rhetorical confusion—perhaps during an explanation.

Mixed-up Words and Repetition:

The text later becomes completely entangled with:

Repetition like "நாம் நாம் நாம்…" ("We we we…")

Random names, programming/tech terms, and possibly nonsense words.
