Whenever there is a disaster or any situation, even if I give a small signal, it is possible for you to identify it clearly. This is like a system where we use codes or signals (like "Z-Varicom-Hurukuria" or "AlphaBets-K-123-26") to communicate reliably and live safely.

We have certain trusted methods or subsystems essential for survival. Even though I have been assigned a role, my responsibility is limited. However, due to your efforts or the system, you might be overburdened with the task. This is important, as we need to maintain the system carefully.

In the country, if someone goes missing or if there is a secret operation, only a few people know the truth, and the rest might be smiling or pretending, while the actual secrets remain hidden. There is no transparency, and no one really understands the full picture.

This situation creates confusion and frustration because the system doesn't allow open discussion. Despite efforts to manage or control, things remain complicated and opaque.

Mathematically or symbolically speaking (this part seems like an analogy with matrices and algebra):

If we have certain components A, B, and C representing parts of the system,

There are rules about how these parts interact, combine, or invert,

For example, the inverse of B multiplied with A or AB, and identity matrices,

These are like the rules governing the system's stability and operations.

The system is built such that, through these inverses and combinations, everything should theoretically balance out to the identity (or original state), showing that the system is consistent and can be reversed or corrected.

But practically, things can become complicated with multiple iterations or steps (like multiple matrix multiplications), and you have to keep track of these to ensure the system works correctly.

In short:
You are talking about a complex system (possibly symbolic or a real-world analogy) where signals or codes help identify and manage situations.

There are trusted subsystems vital for security and survival.

Often, there is a lack of transparency and understanding in the system.

You describe this using an analogy with matrix algebra — inverses, identity matrices — to explain how the system should theoretically function.

Despite the theory, practical challenges and confusion remain.
