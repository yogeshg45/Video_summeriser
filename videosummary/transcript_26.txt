ðŸ”¹ 1. Matrix Definition
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Example mentioned: a 3x3 matrix (3 rows and 3 columns).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Rows and Columns
First row, second row, third row

First column, second column, third column
â†’ Understanding how to refer to individual elements in a matrix using their row and column positions.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Diagonal Elements
Elements from top-left to bottom-right in a square matrix:

Position (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc.

These are often important in calculations (e.g., in trace, determinant, identity matrix, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Zero Elements
Mention of 0 values in a matrix:

Important when discussing matrix invertibility or sparsity.

A matrix with a row or column full of zeros can be non-invertible (singular).

ðŸ”¹ 5. Matrix Operations (Implied)
Matrix inversion conditions: canâ€™t invert if determinant is 0 or if matrix has problematic zero rows/columns.

Accessing specific elements based on row and column indexes.

Diagonal elements play roles in certain properties (e.g., in identity matrix: only diagonal is 1, rest 0).

ðŸ”¹ 6. Use in Image Processing (Contextual)
Images can be represented as matrices (especially grayscale or RGB images):

Each pixel value is stored as a number in a matrix.

RGB images are typically represented by 3 matrices: one for Red, one for Green, one for Blue.
