Over the past sessions, we reviewed fundamental matrix concepts—orders, transpose, adjoint, determinant properties—and today worked through five illustrative problems. First, for a square matrix A whose adjoint B satisfies det A = 2, we used the identity det(adj A)=det Aⁿ⁻¹ (with n=3) to form and solve a quadratic in the unknown α, finding α=4. Next, given 3×3 matrices A and B with AB=I and det A=⅛, we applied det (AB)=det A·det B and the rule det (adj M)=det Mⁿ⁻¹ to show det(adj B·adj 2A)=64. In the third problem, for A of order n with adj B and C=3A, we computed det(adj B)/det C by expressing each in terms of det A and canceling factors to arrive at 8. Then, for a non-singular 3×3 A satisfying AAᵀ=AᵀA and B=A⁻¹Aᵀ, we showed B Bᵀ=I by using properties of transpose and inverse. In the fifth example, a 2×2 matrix A with entries depending on x was raised to the fourth power; equating its (1,1) entry to 109 yielded x=±3, and substituting back gave the (2,2) entry as 10. Lastly, imposing A Aᵀ=I on a 2×2 [1–α; α β] matrix led to α=0 or 1 and β=±1, from which α⁴+β⁴=1. We wrapped up by noting that for any 2×2 matrix P with det P=1, det P²⁰²⁴=(det P)²⁰²⁴=1.
