1. Characteristic Equation & Cayley–Hamilton
Definition: For an 
𝑛
×
𝑛
n×n matrix 
𝐴
A, its characteristic polynomial is

det
⁡
(
𝐴
−
𝜆
𝐼
)
=
0.
det(A−λI)=0.
2×2 case:

Use: Plugging 
𝐴
A into its own characteristic polynomial (the Cayley–Hamilton theorem) lets you re-express 
𝐴
2
A 
2
 , 
𝐴
3
A 
3
 , etc., in terms of lower powers and 
𝐼
I. This in turn solves matrix equations like
𝛼
𝐴
2
+
𝛽
𝐴
=
2
𝐼
αA 
2
 +βA=2I
by matching coefficients.

Adjugate:
