 Matrix-Related Concepts Identified in the Text
Matrix Structure:

A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns.

Elements are referred to based on their position (row, column).

Diagonal Elements:

Special mention of elements that lie on the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.

Diagonal elements are important in determining matrix types and operations.

Row Operations and Repetition:

Multiple references to row-wise changes.

Emphasis on repeating row-based transformation ("row change" repeated for effect).

Matrix Equality:

Two matrices are said to be equal if and only if:

They have the same order (same number of rows and columns).

Corresponding elements in both matrices are equal.

Triangular Matrices:

Upper Triangular Matrix:

A matrix where all elements below the diagonal are zero.

Lower Triangular Matrix:

A matrix where all elements above the diagonal are zero.

Mentioned for comparing structures and identifying properties visually.

Square Matrix:

A matrix with equal number of rows and columns.

Often used to define triangular matrices.

Matrix Comparison:

Visual observation used to determine if a matrix is upper or lower triangular.

Structural comparison of multiple matrices.
