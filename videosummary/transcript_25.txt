Writing Any Matrix as the Sum of a Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric Matrix
In this lecture, the concept being discussed is how any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix. This is an important and foundational idea in linear algebra.

🔍 Key Concepts:
Symmetric Matrix:

A matrix is symmetric if A = Aᵗ (transpose of A is equal to A).

Skew-Symmetric Matrix:

A matrix is skew-symmetric if B = -Bᵗ (transpose is the negative of the matrix).

🧮 Example Given:
Matrix A:

A = |  1   3   5 |
    | -6   8   3 |
    | -4   6   5 |
✏️ Step-by-Step Procedure:
Calculate Aᵗ (Transpose of A):

Edit
Aᵗ = |  1  -6  -4 |
     |  3   8   6 |
     |  5   3   5 |
Compute A + Aᵗ:
This gives a symmetric matrix.

Edit
A + Aᵗ = | 2  -3   1 |
         | -3  16  9 |
         | 1   9  10 |
Compute A - Aᵗ:
This gives a skew-symmetric matrix.

Edit
A - Aᵗ = |  0   9   9 |
         | -9   0  -3 |
         | -9   3   0 |
Divide both results by 2:

Symmetric part (S) = ½(A + Aᵗ)
Skew-symmetric part (K) = ½(A - Aᵗ)
Add the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts:

S + K = A
🧠 Conclusion:
Through this example, it's proven that any square matrix A can be decomposed as:

ini

Edit
A = ½(A + Aᵗ) + ½(A - Aᵗ)
Where:

½(A + Aᵗ) is symmetric

½(A - Aᵗ) is skew-symmetric

This is a theorem in linear algebra, and this example serves as a simple illustration of it.
