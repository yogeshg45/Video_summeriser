Math Word Problem (Core Part)
A person is trying to solve a word problem involving two unknowns, typically framed like:

2x + y = 70

x + y = 60

They solve it by elimination or substitution:

From x + y = 60, isolate y = 60 - x

Substitute into the first:
2x + (60 - x) = 70 → x = 10

Then y = 50

Interpretation:

x represents the cost or count of one item (e.g., one "song" or "performance")

y represents another (e.g., a package or combo)

Thus:

One item costs 10

Another item costs 50

Another similar problem:

x + y = 93

x - y = 5

Solution:

Add both: 2x = 98 → x = 49

Then y = 44

Interpretation:

Possibly related to Latha’s parents' ages:

Father = 49

Mother = 44

🔹 Additional Insights
There’s a casual conversation setting with someone buying items (possibly songs or products).

The speaker repeatedly tries to explain solving simultaneous equations.

They reference using substitution and elimination to solve for x and y.

There’s mention of “Latha’s father” and “Latha’s mother,” used as an example for age-related algebra.

🔹 Summary Statement
The speaker is teaching or explaining how to solve systems of linear equations (simultaneous equations) in a practical, conversational Tamil context—using real-life examples like buying items or calculating ages. They use substitution and elimination methods to find values for x and y and relate them back to real-world interpretations like item prices or people's ages.
