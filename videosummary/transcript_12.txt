There is a story about two people, Raja and Ramesh, who communicate secretly by writing messages on a paper in a language that only they understand. They encode their message using a cipher technique with matrices (Hill cipher).

They use a 3x3 key matrix (the cipher key).

The original message is converted into numbers (e.g., A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).

The message is arranged into a matrix form (plain text matrix).

The cipher text matrix is obtained by multiplying the key matrix with the plain text matrix.

To decrypt, you multiply the cipher text matrix by the inverse of the key matrix (key inverse).

The inverse matrix must be calculated modulo 26 to retrieve the original numbers.

After multiplication, the numbers map back to letters to reveal the original message.

The example includes:

Key matrix (3x3) given.

Plain text matrix.

Cipher text matrix (result after multiplication).

Calculation of the inverse key matrix.

Decryption by multiplying cipher text matrix with inverse key matrix to get back the plain text.

This method helps Raja and Ramesh to keep their communication secret so that no one else can understand it.

What is the Hill Cipher?
The Hill cipher is a classical encryption technique based on linear algebra:

Uses matrix multiplication modulo the size of the alphabet (usually 26).

Requires a key matrix that must be invertible modulo 26.

Encryption: Ciphertext = (Key matrix) × (Plaintext matrix) mod 26

Decryption: Plaintext = (Inverse key matrix) × (Ciphertext matrix) mod 26

Example steps:
Assign each letter a number (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).

Convert the plaintext into a vector or matrix form.

Multiply the plaintext matrix by the key matrix modulo 26 to get the ciphertext.

To decrypt, multiply the ciphertext matrix by the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26.

Convert the resulting numbers back into letters.
