There is a mention of distributing chocolates among three people or groups named X, Y, and Z.

The total number of chocolates available is 100.

The problem seems to involve how to fairly or optimally distribute these chocolates (or resources) among X, Y, and Z.

It discusses constraints or limits (like a "boundary" or "limit" to distribution).

There is a concept of finding an allocation that satisfies everyone or certain conditions.

The text also hints at a mathematical or logical approach to solve such problems, such as setting boundaries, constraints, and working with equations or inequalities.

The idea of "combining" or "adding" different parts (like chocolates or resources) to reach a total.

Mentions of variables (X, Y, Z) to represent parts of the whole.

Possibly discussing optimization or equilibrium where the distribution is balanced or meets specific rules.
