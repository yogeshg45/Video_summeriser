Introduction to Matrices and Order of a Matrix
The session begins with a warm greeting and an introduction to the concept of matrices in algebra.

A matrix is defined as a rectangular array of elements (numbers) arranged in rows and columns.

Example given:

ini

Edit
A = [a11 a12 a13
     a21 a22 a23]
Each element in the matrix is identified by its position (i, j) where i is the row number and j is the column number (e.g., a11 is the element in the first row and first column).

Understanding the Order of a Matrix
The order of a matrix is defined as the number of rows × number of columns.

For example, a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns is a 3x3 matrix.

This concept helps in understanding how many elements are in the matrix and where each element is located.

Example Problem: Constructing a Matrix
A problem is discussed where the task is to construct a 3x3 matrix with the formula:

𝑎
𝑖
𝑗
=
𝑖
+
3
𝑗
a 
ij
​
 =i+3j
For each element, the value is calculated by plugging in the respective row number (i) and column number (j).

For example:

a11 = 1 + 3×1 = 4

a12 = 1 + 3×2 = 7

a13 = 1 + 3×3 = 10

The entire matrix is constructed as:

ini

[  4   7  10
   5   8  11
   6   9  12 ]
