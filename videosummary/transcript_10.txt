Concept: Rotation of a point (x, y) by an angle θ
Suppose you have a point P with coordinates 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) in the original coordinate system.

When you rotate the coordinate system (or the point) by an angle 
𝜃
θ, the new coordinates 
(
𝑋
,
𝑌
)
(X,Y) of the point in the rotated system can be found using the rotation matrix:

[
𝑋
𝑌
]
=
[
cos
⁡
𝜃
sin
⁡
𝜃
−
sin
⁡
𝜃
cos
⁡
𝜃
]
[
𝑥
𝑦
]
[ 
X
Y
​
 ]=[ 
cosθ
−sinθ
​
  
sinθ
cosθ
​
 ][ 
x
y
​
 ]
The inverse rotation matrix is:

𝑇
−
1
=
[
cos
⁡
𝜃
−
sin
⁡
𝜃
sin
⁡
𝜃
cos
⁡
𝜃
]
T 
−1
 =[ 
cosθ
sinθ
​
  
−sinθ
cosθ
​
 ]
Explanation with example:
If 
𝜃
=
45
∘
θ=45 
∘
  (which is 
𝜋
/
4
π/4 radians),

And the original point coordinates are 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
(
2
,
2
)
(x,y)=( 
2
​
 , 
2
​
 ),

The rotated coordinates 
(
𝑋
,
𝑌
)
(X,Y) can be computed by multiplying the rotation matrix with the point vector.

Geometrical interpretation:
The angle between the original axis and the rotated axis is 
𝜃
θ.

The length of the vector (distance from origin to the point) remains the same, only its direction changes.

Using the rotation matrix allows us to find the new coordinates in the rotated system without manually calculating trigonometric projections.

Summary:
Rotation in 2D can be represented as a matrix multiplication.

Coordinates after rotation = Rotation matrix 
×
× original coordinates.

Rotation matrix for angle 
𝜃
θ uses 
cos
⁡
𝜃
cosθ and 
sin
⁡
𝜃
sinθ.

This method is widely used in graphics, physics, robotics, and engineering to manipulate points and objects.
