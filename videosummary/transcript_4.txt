In today’s session we tackled four core “celloproblems” on 3×3 determinants and powers of matrices. First, we examined the matrix

𝐴
=
(
1
0
0
1
1
0
1
1
1
)
,
A=

showed by successive multiplication that its first-column entries follow the triangular-number sequence 
1
,
2
,
3
,
6
,
10
,
…
1,2,3,6,10,…, derived the general term 
𝑇
𝑛
=
𝑛
(
𝑛
+
1
)
/
2
T 
n
​
 =n(n+1)/2, and hence found that for 
𝐵
=
𝐴
20
B=A 
20
  the sum of the first-column entries is 
𝑇
20
=
210
T 
20
​
 =210. Next, we evaluated a parameterized 3×3 determinant

​
  
​
 =Ax−12
by applying strategic row-operations and cofactor expansion to show 
𝐴
=
24
A=24. We then looked ahead to a similar problem (a determinant of the form 
𝑥
𝐼
−
4
𝐽
xI−4J) and suggested using elementary transformations to express it in the factorized form 
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑥
)
(
𝑥
−
𝑎
)
2
(a+bx)(x−a)

 . Finally, we considered the family of determinants

​
  
​
 
and, by treating 
𝑏
>
0
b>0 as a variable and applying the AM–GM inequality to its simplified quadratic form, showed the minimum value is 
2
3
2 
3
​
 . Throughout, we reinforced determinant properties—linearity, expansion along rows, behaviour under row-operations—and the practice of linking algebraic patterns (triangular numbers, AM–GM) to efficient problem-solving.
