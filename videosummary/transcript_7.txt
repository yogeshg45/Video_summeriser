Over several examples you repeatedly compute determinants by cofactor‐expansion (e.g.\ for a 2×2 matrix 
𝐴
A, 
det
⁡
𝐴
=
𝑎
11
𝑎
22
−
𝑎
12
𝑎
21
detA=a 
11
​
 a 
22
​
 −a 
12
​
 a 
21
​
 ) and then apply two key determinant identities:

Scaling a matrix: for an 
𝑛
×
𝑛
n×n matrix 
𝐴
A and scalar 
𝑘
k,

det
⁡
(
𝑘
𝐴
)
  
=
  
𝑘
𝑛
 
det
⁡
(
𝐴
)
.
det(kA)=k 
n
 det(A).
In particular, with 
det
⁡
𝐴
=
4
detA=4 for a 2×2 
𝐴
A, one finds
det
⁡
(
2
𝐴
)
=
2
2
⋅
4
=
16
det(2A)=2 
2
 ⋅4=16.

Adjugate (adjoint) determinant: for an 
𝑛
×
𝑛
n×n matrix 
𝐴
A,

det
⁡
(
a
d
j
 
𝐴
)
  
=
  
(
det
⁡
𝐴
)
 
𝑛
−
1
.
det(adjA)=(detA) 
n−1
 .
You then set up an equation of the form

det
⁡
(
a
d
j
(
2
𝐴
)
)
  
=
  
16
𝑛
det(adj(2A))=16 
n
 
and, using 
det
⁡
(
2
𝐴
)
=
16
det(2A)=16 and the above adjugate formula (
𝑛
−
1
n−1=1 when 
𝑛
=
2
n=2), solve for the exponent 
𝑛
n.

Other nuggets include:

Recognizing cubic roots of unity from 
𝑥
2
+
𝑥
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +x+1=0 and using their sum and product properties when they appear as determinant entries.

Exploiting arithmetic‐progression relations (e.g.\ if 
2
,
𝑏
,
𝑐
2,b,c are in A.P.\ then 
𝑏
=
(
2
+
𝑐
)
/
2
b=(2+c)/2) to simplify more complicated 3×3 determinants.

Using AM–GM or perfect‐square factorizations to bound expressions arising from parameterized determinants.

Across all these, the core toolkit is (1) determinant expansion, (2) the scaling law 
det
⁡
(
𝑘
𝐴
)
=
𝑘
𝑛
det
⁡
𝐴
det(kA)=k 
n
 detA, and (3) the adjugate formula 
det
⁡
(
a
d
j
𝐴
)
=
(
det
⁡
𝐴
)
𝑛
−
1
det(adjA)=(detA) 
n−1
 .
