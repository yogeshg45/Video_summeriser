and find all real 
𝑘

.
Δ=det( 
k+1
k
​
  
8

​
 )=(k+1)(k+3)−8k=(k−1)(k−3).
For “no solution” we need 
Δ
=
0
Δ=0 but 
Δ
𝑥
≠
0
Δ 
x
​
 

=0 or 
Δ
𝑦
≠
0
Δ 
y
​
 

=0.

Δ
=
0
Δ=0 ⇒ 
𝑘
=
1
k=1 or 
𝑘
=
3
k=3.

Test 
𝑘
=
1
k=1: one finds 
Δ
𝑥
=
Δ
𝑦
=
0
Δ 
x
​
 =Δ 
y
​
 =0 ⇒ infinitely many solutions.

Test 
𝑘
=
3
k=3: one finds, say, 
Δ
𝑥
≠
0
Δ 
x
​
 

=0. ⇒ no solution.

Answer: only 
𝑘
=
3
k=3.

Example 2 (Three variables, no solution)
Solve

{
𝑥
+
𝑎
𝑦
+
𝑧
=
3
,
𝑥
+

⎩

⎧
​

and find all real 
𝑎
,
𝑏

−
𝑎
.
Δ=(1)(2⋅3−2⋅5)−a(1⋅3−2⋅1)+1(1⋅5−2⋅1)=−4−a(1)+3=−1−a.
So 
Δ
=
0
Δ=0 ⇔ 
𝑎
=
−

a=−1.

For inconsistency (
Δ
=

Δ=0 but not all

Δ
𝑦
,
Δ

Δ

 ,Δ

 ,Δ

​
  vanish), substitute 
𝑎
=
−
1
a=−1 into, e.g., 
Δ
𝑥
Δ 
x
​
 . One finds 
Δ
𝑥
≠
0
Δ 
x
​
 

=0 unless 
𝑏
=
9
b=9.

Answer: 
  
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
=
(
−
1
,
 
9
)
.
(a,b)=(−1,9).

Solve

𝑥

Hence there are two unit-vector solutions.

Example 4 (Homogeneous system, infinitely many solutions vs. none)
A system

⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
x+λy−z=0,
λx−y−z=0,
x+y−λz=0
​
 
is homogeneous. One checks its coefficient determinant,
Δ
(
𝜆
)
Δ(λ), and finds the values of 
𝜆
λ that make 
Δ
=
0
Δ=0. Those 
𝜆
λ-values give either infinitely many solutions (if all 
Δ
𝑥
,
Δ
𝑦
,
Δ
𝑧
Δ 
x
​
 ,Δ 
y
​
 ,Δ

​
  also vanish) or else the trivial solution only.

3. Key Takeaways
Homogeneous vs. non-homogeneous systems.

Use the determinant 
Δ
Δ of the coefficient matrix to decide:

Δ
≠
0
Δ

=0 ⇒ unique solution.

Δ
=
0
Δ=0:

all 
Δ
𝑖
=
0
Δ 
i
​
 =0 ⇒ infinitely many solutions;

some 
Δ
𝑖
≠
0
Δ 
i
​
 

=0 ⇒ no solution.

Cramer’s Rule for the unique-solution case: 
𝑥
𝑖
=
Δ
𝑖
/
Δ
x 
i
​
 =Δ 
i
​
 /Δ.

For homogeneous systems with 
Δ
=
0
Δ=0, look for nontrivial solution families (one-parameter, two-parameter, …), then impose any extra constraint (e.g.\ a normalization 
𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
+
𝑧
2
=
1
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 =1) to select specific vectors.

These ideas scale from 2×2 up to 3×3 (and beyond) systems.
